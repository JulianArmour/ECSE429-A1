**ArithmeticMutantGenerator** is a program that takes in two arguments. It reads from a source code file and generates  
mutants for each arithmetic operation that are written to an output file that holds the library of mutants.  
  
The usage is as follows:  
  

    $ ArithmeticMutantGenerator arg1 arg2 

  
*arg1*: The path to a source code file.
  
*arg2*: The path to an output file for the mutant library.

**ArithmeticMutantFileGenerator** reads from a source file, a Mutant Fault List 
(generated from ArithmeticMutantGenerator for the source file) and outputs a source file for each mutant, with the
mutant injected in it.

It can be used as follows:

    $ ArithmeticMutantFileGenerator arg1 arg2 arg3
    
*arg1*: The path to a source code file

*arg2*: The path to a Mutant Fault List generated by ArithmeticMutantGenerator for *arg1*

*arg3*: A path to a directory (existing or not) where the mutated sources are output to.
